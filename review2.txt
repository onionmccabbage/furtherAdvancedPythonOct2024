Python Review Exercise 2
========================
For this project, use modules and imports to separate your code structures
Use the 'WeatherGetter' service (e.g. import it).
Write a thread runner (class or function)
Initialize it to take a 'city' parameter. 
Declare a 'run' method for this class. (Or target a function as a Thread)

You will need something like this at the top of your module:
  from threading import Thread
  import requests

In the 'run' method, populate a response object by calling 'requests.get' for this end-point:
  http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=athlone&units=metric&APPID=957d663a2296945e39a56609740a2548
  (replace 'athlone' with the city parameter)
  (You may choose to sign up for a free API key, or use my API key, good for 60 requests/min)
Populate a 'data' object from the response as JSON, then set self.temperature to the returned temperature, e.g.
  data = response.json()	   # convert the returned reponse to JSON
  self.temperature = data['main']['temp']  # access the temperature property from the JSON
(You could also read the weather description, wind speed and direction)

In another module, declare a list of cities, e.g. 
  CITIES = ['Athlone', 'Dublin', 'Galway', 'Belfast', 'Genoa', 'Cork', 'Budapest', 'Kista']
Import your WeatherGetter
Iterate over these cities, starting a new thread for your 'WeatherGetter' for each city

There is no need to use observables for this (unless you would like to)

Print out the temperature for each of the cities
Optionaly include code to time how long it takes to retrieve all the weather reports
Remember to code against the main types of error that might occur here

If Time
------- 
Use a semaphore, since the weather service can certainly handle more than one request at a time
Declare a data structure to record each city and temperature, along with a time-stamp
Each thread should add to this structure, using locks as needed (enter nulls on error)
When all threads complete, persist the contents of this structure to a text file (overwrite each time)
Subsequent runs of your code should first read this file, then calculate (and display) any temperature difference between the current and previous values
Over short time scales, this temperature difference will often be zero

Optional
--------
Also show other weather data, such as wind speed and direction, the weather description etc.
Show the temperature as Celcius (the default), Kelvin (-273) and Fahrenheit (°F=°C*1.8+32.0)

Try retrieving a lot of cities (but be careful of the 60-a-minute limit):
Here is a list of many of the cities of Ireland:
["Dublin","Cork","Limerick","Galway","Waterford","Drogheda","Kilkenny","Wexford","Sligo","Clonmel","Dundalk","Bray","Ennis","Tralee","Carlow","Naas","Athlone","Letterkenny","Tullamore","Killarney","Arklow","Cobh","Castlebar","Midleton","Mallow","Ballina","Enniscorthy","Wicklow","Cavan","Athenry","Longford","Dungarvan","Nenagh","Trim","Thurles","Youghal","Monaghan","Buncrana","Ballinasloe","Fermoy","Westport","Carrick-on-Suir","Birr","Tipperary","Carrickmacross","Kinsale","Listowel","Clonakilty","Cashel","Macroom","Castleblayney","Kilrush","Skibbereen","Bundoran","Templemore","Clones","Newbridge","Mullingar","Balbriggan","Greystones","Leixlip","Tramore","Shannon","Gorey","Tuam","Edenderry","Bandon","Loughrea","Ardee","Mountmellick","Bantry","Boyle","Ballyshannon","Cootehill","Ballybay","Belturbet","Lismore","Kilkee","Granard"]

Try This
--------
Use the 'lon' and 'lat' values to store retrieved weather data as a text file including 'lon' and 'lat'
