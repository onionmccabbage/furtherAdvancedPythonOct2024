Beyond Advanced Python Review Exercise 1 50 minutes (until 2:30)
========================================

Individually or in groups, tackle as many of these challenges as you like, in any order
There will be a chance to show your thinking after the exercise

At the end please 'show and tell'

Decorator Pattern
- Write a decorator function that ensures all positional arguments are non-empty string
  Any positional arguments that fail validation should raise a typeError
- expand this decorator for other kinds of validation (eg int, float, numeric, instance-of)
- also validate keyword args

Facade and Factory patterns
- Write the creature factory example to provide a facade to all the creatures
- consider if the 'Manager' facade could be sensibly implemented as a factory

Constructor Pattern
- Write an abstract base class that insists __str__ is implemented
- Extend all the classes in the 'facade' pattern to implement this base class
- Write __str__ methods to satisfy this restriction

Built-in Methods
- We met __str__ , __repr__ and __del__. Now explore other built-in methods of Python objects
  __enter__ ,  __exit__ , __run__

Or just play with design patterns to implement your own coding solutions
